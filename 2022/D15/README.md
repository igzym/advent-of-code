https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/15

- input: Sensor locations in a 2D grid with closest sensor reported
  by each one, using Manhattan distance; coordinates can be negative.
  For each sensor and beacon pair you know that no other beacon at
  distance closer or equal exist, so you can map areas of space
  that cannot contain a beacon 
- puzzle 1: in row 2000000, how many positions cannot contain a beacon
