D08 Resonant Collinearity
=========================

https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/8

Run as

    python collinearity.py -part=1 input.txt

## Skill required

- part 1: Linear transformations in a bounded 2D space
- part 2: As above, but extend the mapping until in the map

Note: for part 2 I tried some fancy math formulas to determine the
range in advance, but that was too complicated. In the end I just
try extending until no antinodes generated for a pair fall on the grid


## Answers

- part 1: 367
- part 2: 1285
